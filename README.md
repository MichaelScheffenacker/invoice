# invoices

This is just a very simple project, written in `php 7` to manage my own invoices.
It allows to save the invoice details in a database and generates a ready-to-use `pdf` file via LaTex.

A peek into the `includes/` and `tests/` directories might give an insight into my current coding style.
I try to keep close to the coding guide lines of Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin).
The project specific files on the top level of the file hierarchy are not really worth looking,
since they are still messy and not really interesting by general means.

When I have time, I refactor the general parts to prepare them for other similar and simple database usages.
